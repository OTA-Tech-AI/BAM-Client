# BAM-Client

This repository provides an out-of-the-box tool for utilizing [OTA's Browser Action Model (BAM)](https://github.com/OTA-Tech-AI/OTA-v1), with enhanced features built on top of existing frameworks. It is intended as a supplementary repo to the model, enabling seamless interaction with web environments through a browser-based agent system.

This repo is **forked from**:

- [Browser-Use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) (last commit Mar 16 2025) ‚Äì provides the core browser action framework.
- [WebVoyager](https://github.com/MinorJerry/WebVoyager) ‚Äì contributes the concurrency design and result-saving mechanism.

## üß† About OTA's BAM

The [Browser Action Model (BAM)](https://github.com/OTA-Tech-AI/OTA-v1) is a lightweight, non-generative model designed by OTA Technology Inc. for intelligent browser-based automation. This repository makes it easy to plug BAM into a fully functional browser action loop with minimal setup.

## üì¶ Get Started

Please refer to the [OTA-v1](https://github.com/OTA-Tech-AI/OTA-v1) for model setup.

### env setup
Setup your virtual environment using pip:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### API Key
create a file named **.env** under the root directory and add your API key for LLM, for example:

`OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj...`

### Prepare Tasks

To create your own tasks, follow the format used in the test files under the `testcases/` directory. For example, a task in `OTA_testdataset_mini.jsonl` looks like this:

```json
{"web_name": "Allrecipes", "id": "Allrecipes--4", "ques": "Find a recipe for Baked Salmon that takes less than 30 minutes to prepare and has at least a 4 star rating based on user reviews.", "web": "https://www.allrecipes.com/"}
```

**web_name**: the website name you want to visit in this task

**id**: a unique ID for the task

**ques**: what you want browser-use to do

**web**: link to the website

please refer to [WebVoyager](https://github.com/MinorJerry/WebVoyager) for more information.

### Execute your tasks
Run the following command to start the task:

`python run_tasks.py --model-provider openai --max-concurrent 1 --task_jsonl_path testcases/OTA_testdataset_mini.jsonl`


## üîß Improvements Over the Original `browser-use` Framework

We have extended and improved the `browser-use` framework with the following key features:

1. **Similarity-Based Element Selection**  
   We integrate **similarity search** into the web page content symbol space to **select only the top-K relevant interactive elements**. These are chosen based on their relevance to the agent's next sub-goal, improving both efficiency and model performance.

2. **Action History Limiting**  
   To manage token usage and avoid overwhelming the LLM, we limit the number of previous actions included in the prompt. This helps maintain a concise and effective context for decision-making.
